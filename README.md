# Building a Portfolio Page

## Learning Objectives

- Properly indent HTML for maximum readability
- Distinguish between IDs and classes
- Distinguish between block and inline elements
- Given CSS selectors, explain which elements they would select
- Match CSS properties to their function
- Publish a website on the Web using Github Pages
- Describe the problem(s) solved by flexbox

## Framing

Github Pages is a free service through which you can publish your own webpage at the `github.io` domain. Many developers use "GH Pages" for their own blogs, portfolio pages, or informational pages about their projects.

This class is video-based. This series of videos shows the whole process of creating from scratch and publishing an appealing (or at least hopefully-not-awful-looking -- I'm not a designer) portfolio page.

This is intended both to introduce GH Pages and review the basics of HTML and CSS.
